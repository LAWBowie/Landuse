# Landuse
In this study, I delved into the patterns of land usage, measured in hectares, across English Local Authority Districts (LADs). The primary goal was to uncover any geographical trends in the distribution of different land use types across England, pinpointing any associations with specific LADs. Objectives encompassed identifying potential correlations between particular land use types and LADs, alongside assessing the reliability and coverage of the data leveraged for the analysis.<br>

This was completed as a project for my final year at University.

Final score: A
